# Neocities
Pandgum's Neocities branch site. This is not updated anymore sadly but it's still open source!

See it in action at https://pandgum.neocities.org
Credit to TabTray for some of the coding from his website that I took (his site is open source) and idea for making this site! Another thanks is to npxl32 for help on coding, bug fixes, and yelling at me! His site will be open source soon too!
